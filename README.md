# Data_Viz_Final

## Summary
This is an interactive shiny app for my final Data Visualization project. It allows the user to explore two datasets based on world bank data and car accidents in the UK. There are several visualizations that allow the user to input variables from the datasets so they can explore the data how they see fit.

## Design Choices
For the world bank data I included a trend plot, scatter plot, and a geographic plot for users to explore. The trend plot will allow users to plot a selection of variables against a rainge of years colored by selected countries. The scatter plot allows users to view the relationship between two variables of their choosing, and the geographic plot shows a world map colored by a variable the user choses for one year that they also choose. For the UK car accident data I included trend plot, bar charts, and a heat map. The trend tab includes a trend plot showing the trend of total casualties per year as well as two bar charts showing casualties by day of the week, and casualties by road type. The user can switch between charts with a dropdown. The heat map shows the density of car accidents weighted by number of casualties in the accident by year. The user can select the year they are viewing as well as the severity level. The map allows for the user to zoom in and out if they want to get a better look at a specific area. There is also a tab showing a small verion of each dataset. The UK car accident data was missing a few context files so I was a bit limited my what I could plot and still have it make sense to the user. I still think that you can still explore the most important parts of the dataset with the visualizations that I chose.
